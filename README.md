At this moment the project has a basic abstraction of Vertex Buffer and Vertex Array. It handle simple Textures and very soon it will be able to load .OBJ files.

I am working in my own Math library for the game engine or GUI. There is still too many things to do. The next step after creating the Math Library and handleling with complex models is learning about lightening and more advanced topics of Shaders.
